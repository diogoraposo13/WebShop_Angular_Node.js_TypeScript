(This project is currently under development)

Welcome to the Webshop Tutorial repository!

This repository documents a YouTube tutorial I followed to practice and enhance my skills in building webshops using Angular, TypeScript, Express.js, and Stripe.

In this project, we'll explore UI design with Angular Material and Tailwind, API integration, and payment processing through Stripe.
